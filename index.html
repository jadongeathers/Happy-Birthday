Crystal,
<br><br>
<strong>HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!!</strong> Despite the relatively short time I have known you, it is a genuine privilege to have you as a close friend. It has not taken much conversation for me to understand you are an authentically good person with a wonderful mind and beautiful heart.
<br><br>
Clearly, with the numerous uncertainties I (and you) will face this year regarding Stanford and life in general, I have been feeling quite apprehensive about attending university this year and have inevitably felt insecure about the future. However, amidst these troubling thoughts, it is truly a pleasure to discover beacons of light like you‚Äîfriends who are interesting, kind, understanding, humorous, and so much more. 
<br><br>
The ease through which you continue conversation with me is lovely, and I always enjoy getting to call you through FaceTime (and on Zoom with Chad LOL). Talking to you always brings me joy! What also brings me joy: watching your La Campanella video (and others) on repeat 50 times a day.
<br><br>
As we celebrate this amazing day on which you were born, I‚Äôm so grateful that you not only came into this world, but also came into my life to make things just a bit brighter for me. Already online, you‚Äôve simply been a wonderfully enjoyable companion, and I hope I will get to celebrate many more of your birthdays as your friend at Stanford and beyond!
<br><br> 
As you grow older, I know you will continue to prosper in whatever you do as long as you walk this earth. Happy eighteenth; hope you deservedly enjoy this special day with your loved ones! üòÑ
<br><br>
Love,<br>
Jadon
